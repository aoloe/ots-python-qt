# ots-python-qt

Draft for an opentechschool workshop on creating GUI applications with Python and Qt.

The goal is to create a tutorial that introduces the basics of GUI programming with Python by showing how to create a simple and specialized spreadsheet.

The tutorial is based on the pyside/pyqt talk by Aaron Richiger (https://github.com/raaron/pyside_talk)

#TODO
- add a restructured text filter on top of markdown in my github site builder.
